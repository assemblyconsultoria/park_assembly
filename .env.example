# Notes:
# - The docker-compose is configured to connect to PostgreSQL running on your host machine
# - Make sure PostgreSQL is running locally on port 5432
# - The database 'projetos' must exist before starting the application
# - host.docker.internal is used to access the host machine from within Docker containers
